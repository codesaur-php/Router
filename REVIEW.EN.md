# Code Review

**Language:** [🇲🇳 Монгол](REVIEW.md) | [🇬🇧 English](REVIEW.EN.md)

This document is a code review report for the `codesaur/router` package.

---

## Overall Assessment

✅ **Very well written code** - Years of experience is evident  
✅ **Stable architecture** - Interface and implementation are well separated  
✅ **Complete tests** - All functions tested using PHPUnit  
✅ **Good documentation** - PHPDoc and comments are very detailed  

---

## Code Quality

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Interface usage**
   - `RouterInterface` defines the contract and guides implementation
   - Makes dependency injection and testing easier

2. **Magic method usage**
   - `__call()` method is very convenient for dynamically calling HTTP methods
   - Supports method chaining (`->name()`)

3. **Parameter type checking**
   - Typed parameters like `{int:id}`, `{uint:page}`, `{float:price}`
   - Improves type safety

4. **Regex pattern matching**
   - Efficient pattern matching
   - URL encoding/decoding is done correctly

5. **Callback wrapper**
   - `Callback` class well separates callable and parameters
   - Maintains separation of concerns

6. **Router merge**
   - Ability to merge module routes
   - Suitable for modular architecture

---

## Security

### ✅ Well Done

1. **Type validation**
   - Parameter types are validated
   - Exceptions are thrown correctly

2. **URL encoding**
   - `rawurlencode()` and `rawurldecode()` used correctly
   - Ensures XSS security

3. **Input validation**
   - Route pattern and callback are validated
   - `InvalidArgumentException` is thrown correctly

### ⚠️ Things to Note

1. **Regex injection**
   - `FILTERS_REGEX` should not be used directly from user input
   - Currently route patterns come from developers, so it's safe

2. **Path traversal**
   - `match()` method doesn't check for path traversal like `../`
   - If coming directly from user input, additional checks are needed

---

## Performance

### ✅ Well Done

1. **Pattern matching**
   - Regex is efficient
   - Good performance even with many routes

2. **Memory usage**
   - Small objects
   - Arrays don't take up too much memory

### 💡 Improvement Opportunities

1. **Route caching**
   - Currently routes are matched at runtime
   - If there are many routes, caching would be better

2. **Early exit optimization**
   - `match()` method returns the first matching route
   - Sorting routes by priority would be faster

---

## Code Structure

### ✅ Well Done

1. **Namespace**
   - `codesaur\Router` namespace used correctly
   - Complies with PSR-4 autoloading standard

2. **Class structure**
   - Classes follow single responsibility principle
   - `Router` and `Callback` are well separated

3. **Method organization**
   - Public methods are logically organized
   - Private methods are only for internal use

### 💡 Improvement Opportunities

1. **Constants organization**
   - Regex constants are in the class
   - If adding many filter types, a configuration class would be better

---

## Tests

### ✅ Well Done

1. **Test coverage**
   - All public methods are tested
   - Edge cases are also tested

2. **Test structure**
   - `RouterTest` and `CallbackTest` are well separated
   - Test methods have clear names

### 💡 Improvement Opportunities

1. **Integration tests**
   - Currently only unit tests exist
   - Adding integration tests would be better

2. **Performance tests**
   - Test performance with many routes
   - Add benchmark tests

---

## Documentation

### ✅ Well Done

1. **PHPDoc**
   - ✅ All public methods are thoroughly documented
   - ✅ Parameter and return types are clear
   - ✅ `@const` annotation used on constants
   - ✅ Exceptions are clearly documented

2. **Comments**
   - ✅ Comments in Mongolian language
   - ✅ Makes code easy to read
   - ✅ Inline comments explain logic sections

3. **README.md**
   - ✅ Usage examples included
   - ✅ Installation and quick start guide included
   - ✅ CI/CD badges added
   - ✅ Documentation links added

4. **API.md**
   - ✅ Detailed documentation of all public APIs
   - ✅ Methods, parameters, exceptions
   - ✅ Example code included

5. **REVIEW.md**
   - ✅ Code review report
   - ✅ Strengths and improvement opportunities

### ✅ Improvements Made

1. **PHPDoc improvements**
   - ✅ `@const` annotation used on constants
   - ✅ `@return static` used (method chaining)
   - ✅ Callable types made more specific

2. **Example file**
   - ✅ PHPDoc added to all methods
   - ✅ Comments made more detailed

3. **Documentation**
   - ✅ More examples added to README.md
   - ✅ More detailed descriptions added to API.md

---

## PSR Standards

### ✅ Done

1. **PSR-4 Autoloading**
   - Composer autoload configured correctly
   - Namespace structure complies with standard

2. **PSR-12 Coding Style**
   - Code complies with PSR-12 standard
   - Indentation, brace position are correct

### ⚠️ Things to Check

1. **PSR-1 Basic Coding Standard**
   - ✅ Class names are StudlyCaps
   - ✅ Method names are camelCase
   - ✅ Constants are UPPER_CASE

2. **PSR-12 Extended Coding Style**
   - ✅ Opening braces are positioned correctly
   - ✅ Indentation is correct (4 spaces)

---

## Possible Improvements

### 🔄 Medium Priority

1. **Route groups**
   - Group multiple routes with one prefix
   - Add middleware support

2. **Route caching**
   - Cache compiled routes
   - Improve performance in production environment

3. **Route middleware**
   - Route level middleware support
   - Authentication, authorization, etc.

### 🔮 Long-term

1. **Route model binding**
   - Automatically bind route parameters to models like Laravel

2. **Route resource**
   - Automatically generate RESTful resource routes

3. **Route subdomain**
   - Subdomain-based routing
